  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
  # For 100k concurrent users, this would need to be significantly higher,
  # and other bottlenecks (database, API logic) must be addressed.
  # This is an illustrative change; optimal values depend on load testing.
  maxInstances: 50 # Increased from 1, adjust based on actual needs and testing
  # minInstances: 2 # Optional: consider setting minInstances for faster cold start responses
  # concurrency: 100 # Optional: Max concurrent requests per instance
  # cpu: 1 # Optional: CPU allocation
  # memoryMiB: 512 # Optional: Memory allocation
