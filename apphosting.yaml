# Settings to manage and configure a Firebase App Hosting backend.

  # The number of consecutive requests your App Hosting backend can process.
  # Concurrency has a significant impact on scaling and instance cost.
  # Higher concurrency means fewer instances are needed to handle traffic,
  # but it can also lead to increased latency if your backend is slow to respond.
  # We've chosen a higher concurrency to optimize for cost-efficiency.
  concurrency: 80

  # The maximum number of instances that can be created for your backend.
  # This setting is a safety mechanism to prevent uncontrolled scaling and costs.
  # For a production app with 100k concurrent users, this value would need
  # to be significantly higher, and other bottlenecks (database, API logic)
  # would need to be addressed. This is an illustrative value; optimal
  # settings depend on load testing.
  maxInstances: 20

  # The minimum number of instances to keep running at all times.
  # Setting this to 0 is recommended for development and staging environments
  # to save costs, as the app will scale to zero when idle. For production,
  # you might set this to 1 or higher to ensure there's always an instance
  # ready to serve traffic, reducing cold start latency.
  minInstances: 0
